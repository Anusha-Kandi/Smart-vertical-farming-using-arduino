# Smart-vertical-farming-using-arduino
In this project the farming is done in a vertical manner. Each level of vertical is fixed with soil moisture and servo motor. Whenever the soil in the first level reaches the particular value the servo motor opens the cap which is connected to the servo motor. 
This procedure is continued for the last level and a tank is placed at the last level. In this tank we can store the excess water for the further usage.
